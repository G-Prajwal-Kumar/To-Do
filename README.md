# To-Do
  
This To-Do app, developed using Flutter, is a mobile application designed to help users manage and organize their tasks efficiently. The app utilizes the Flutter framework, providing a cross-platform experience for both Android and iOS users.  

One notable feature of this To-Do app is the implementation of local storage using SQLite. SQLite is a lightweight and embedded relational database management system, commonly used in mobile app development for storing and retrieving data locally. By incorporating SQLite into your app, it enable users to store their task-related information directly on their device, ensuring data persistence even when the app is closed or the device is offline.  
  
With the app, users can add, edit, and delete tasks, keeping track of their to-do lists conveniently. The local storage functionality ensures that task data is stored securely on the user's device, offering a seamless and responsive experience. The combination of Flutter's flexible UI development capabilities and SQLite's local storage solutions makes your ToDo app a versatile and user-friendly task management tool.
